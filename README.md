# AMC_preprocess
## Python Signal Pre-processing Library for AMC (or more applications ... we certainly hope that this repository will not only be used for AMC ... )

This work corresponds to the IEEE Access paper: <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9852206>

Initially, to reproduce the results, please download the dataset first: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pinxau1000/radioml2018>

Our train and test only use a subset of it, as the original one has 20GB which is not good for LDA classifier. To generate the subset and then reproduce the experiments, just simply following:

1.	Change the `hf = h5py.File('path/to/the/GOLD_XYZ_OSC.0001_1024.hdf5', 'r+')` in `gen_subset.py` into the path that can navigate to the dataset.

2.	Use `bash train_test.sh` run the whole program, here you can choose different classifiers, if you have cuda please set `cuda=true` as itâ€™ll be crazy slow if you only use `Numpy`.

3.	Obviously, this work has some dependency requirements, please use `pip` or `conda` install them first. (you could just follow the python errors to check what you need)

4.	This program will generate some `.txt` and `.png` automatically, including the test accuracy and confusion matrixes.

Please let me know if you have any question! You can email us or leave comments in Issues!
